   <p> 
       To everyone reading this "Welcome to my page", first thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio. My name is Laury Benoit born in Haiti. I find myself falling in love with coding back in 2018. I was browsing through my company files, I stumbled upon a python file. Instantly I was intrigued then I remember vaguely some coding I learned back in college. I was more determine at that point to learn more python so I can help my customer a bit more. I was working in the government transportation sector at a company called Routematch as an Implementation Project Manager. Then I started my python journey at Lynda.com and learning from my peers at the company. I found myself wanting to know more, that's when I started my self-thought journey. I learned so much over a 26 weeks, touching different libraries, frameworks, and software. In my career change journey, I want to be completely transparent to my future employer. I am new and a continuous learner in need of an opportunity. I never give up on any projects or ambitions. For seven years, I worked as a Project Manager leading different technical software implementations. I now want to be a part of making the application.
